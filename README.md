- ### 3-D Bin Packing problem [‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://github.com/Satpute-Aniket/3DPacking)

  This project addresses the complex and NP-hard 3D Container Loading Problem, where the goal is to optimize the assignment and packing of items into containers while minimizing overall costs. Our team developed the solution using both exact and heuristic methods to tackle this problem, utilizing tools like Gurobi, Python, and various data visualization techniques. The project focuses on three key aspects: optimizing the spatial arrangement of items within containers, ensuring the feasibility of container transport to designated destinations, and reducing costs associated with the logistics process.

  We implemented a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model for the optimal assignment of items to containers, ensuring that items do not overlap, that weight and volume constraints are respected, and that the packing configuration minimizes unused space. Additionally, we employed heuristic methods to manage large-scale problems where exact methods are impractical. By combining rigorous data engineering, exploratory data analysis, and innovative optimization techniques, we achieved a cost-efficient solution with a packing efficiency of 95.62%, processing 2,386 items into 135 containers.

  #### Libraries used : Matplotlib, Padas, Numpy, mpl_toolkits, gurobipy.
  #### Technologies used üíª : Optimization, Heuristics, Data Analysis, Data Engineering, Python, Visual Studio Code.

- ### Prediction of health expenses incurred by insurances [‚ÜóÔ∏è]()

  In this project, we begin with a comprehensive initial data exploration, aiming to identify and report all interesting and relevant insights that will guide the construction of our model. The data is presented through concise textual descriptions, tables, and plots, ensuring that the findings are both informative and actionable.

  We will compare and demonstrate the correct application of various model selection methodologies, evaluating their performance systematically. Our approach includes careful consideration of hyperparameters, explaining the model selection procedure and the rationale behind the chosen values. We will explore multiple hyperparameter configurations, with the assumption that we have access to extensive computational resources, particularly for hyperparameter tuning.

  The primary regression metric used for evaluating model performance is the Mean Squared Error (MSE). Additionally, we will provide visualizations of residual plots to further assess the model's accuracy and reliability.

  #### Libraries used : scikit-learn, seaborn, Padas, Numpy.
  #### Technologies used üíª : Machine Learning, Python, Google Colab.
