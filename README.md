I made this project just for fun, it allows you to create nice and simple GitHub Readme files that you can copy/paste and use in your profile.

Skills: Python / R / SQL / Data Cleaning / Data Analysis / Data Visualisation / Machine Learning / RAG 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my master thesis, which revolves around fine-tuning a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model that I created during my internship. The RAG model extracts critical information from unstructured pdfs in real time. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning M.Sc. in Data Analytics and Decision Science at RWTH Aachen University. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects utilising any new, cutting-edge technologies in Data Analytics and Machine Learning as I love to learn about some new stuff. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can cook really well, and I am always up to try new cuisines!
