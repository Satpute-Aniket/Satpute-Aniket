I'm a passionate data scientist with a background in mechanical engineering and a master's degree in Data Analytics and Decision Science from RWTH Aachen University. My interests lie at the intersection of data, technology, and innovation. I love solving complex problems using machine learning, AI, and modern web technologies.

Skills: 
- 📊 Data Analysis & Visualization (Python, Pandas, Numpy, Tableau, Power BI)
- 🧠 Machine Learning & AI (Scikit-Learn, LangChain)
- 🗃️ Databases (SQL, vector DB) 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my master thesis, which revolves around fine-tuning a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model that I created during my internship. The RAG model extracts critical information from unstructured pdfs in real time. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning M.Sc. in Data Analytics and Decision Science at RWTH Aachen University. 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects utilising any new, cutting-edge technologies in Data Analytics and Machine Learning as I love to learn about some new stuff. 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can cook really well, and I am always up to try new cuisines!

✨ Projects:
- RAG application for document Review
- 3-D Bin Packing problem
